## ‚ÑπÔ∏è **About**

* **FlagSecure Disabler**
  
  Gives you the freedom to take screenshots anywhere on your device, without restrictions
* **Screenshot Observer Disabler (Android 14+)**
  
  Allows you to prevent third-party apps from registering when you take screenshots.  
  
  **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning**: Disabling the Screenshot Observer may interfere with the functionality of specialized screenshot apps that rely on detecting screenshot events.
* **DRM (Digital Restrictions Management) Disabler**
  
  Provides a basic solution for multimedia content that won't load or displays an error message due to DRM verification failures.
  
  **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning**: This isn't a true fix for the DRM; rather, it's a force solution that disables it. While it may work in most cases, it can also cause limitations in some apps, such as preventing the use of high-quality options and more.
